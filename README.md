This project includes slides from the "Hex Osc Shift Mod" workshop presented at the International Conference on Live Coding 2020 in Limerick, Ireland, held February 5-7th, 2020. A four-part exploration into the four main sections of the workshop, discussing hexadecimal notation, event-rate oscillators, bit-shifts and bit manipulations, and modulus divisions for additive/subtractive rhythms, is planned but not yet written. The chapter sections are linked below:
