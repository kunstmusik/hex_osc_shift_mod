# Shift

* Powers of 2 rule bit sequences

* Rate of change, dealing with powers of 2 for change
* Modulus constrains
  * modulus by power of two will give very static output sequences
  * churn by using non-power of two

## Bitwise-and, Bitwise-or

bitwise-and 

p4 & 0x7 
constrain

p4 & 0x7 == 0x7
mask equals (contains exact set of bits)  ; every

p4 & 0x7 > 0
mask -> greater (contains some part of set of bits)   ; some
